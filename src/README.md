# Rust Project

Add a description of your project here.
This project uses the (disgusting) Rust language to create a program that allows a user
to add a person to a vector(list) as a struct containing the persons age and name.
You can view the list, add to it, delete it, and search people by age.

## Instructions for Build and Use
For this you will need RustRover. Additonally in order to get it to work I had to download
a tool file related to C# from visual studio tools.

1. Have RustRover
2. Have the visual studio c# tools foled
3. Copy repository
4. hit run

Instructions for using the software:
